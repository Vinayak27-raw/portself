                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am an aspiring Community Evangelist who loves working in the tech community: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and an academic background in computer science engineering, statistics, and program management.

My passion lies in solving business problems with tailored data and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders. I just love managing and executing programs.

In my graduate studies, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, including leading a TEDx event at my campus, coordinating with a incubation team and executing their program for 500+ people, and working with tech giants such as Major League Hacking and Turing.com.

I'm graduating in May 2023 and I'm interested in full-time Program Management or Community Management roles. Please feel free to get in touch with me via email at vinayakrawat292@gmail.com

I love working with startup ideas too, adding here have won Hult Prize On Campus 2022, also the Winner of the Chhattisgarh state level Innovation competition in 2020
